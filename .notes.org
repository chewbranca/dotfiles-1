* things that bug me about software I use (a relatively complete list)
** Debian
   - many versions way out of date in squeeze
     - whatever, just use nix
       - figure out how to compile a 32-bit openjdk
       - FF on nix doesn't honor GTK theme or timezone
   - powertop watts estimate is off by at least an order of magnitude
     Apparently [[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug%3D497929][fixed upstream]]
   - installer hardcodes ssid/mount point in /etc (reported)
     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=502955 (net)
     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=646795 (fstab)
** eshell
   - no tab completion for git branches
   - sudo commands cannot be interrupted
** leiningen
   - version 2 isn't finished
** conkeror
   - it isn't emacs
   - after six months of usage its history starts slowing down completion
   - hacker news isn't keyboard-friendly
** gnus
   - imap is slow
   - doesn't handle switching network connections very well
   - no way to report spam without switching to browser
   - search is hard to set up
** rcirc
   - colors don't use consistent hashing
** znc
   - doesn't save session state in between restarts
     (needs to be more than just saving to disk for running on Heroku)
** swank-clojure
   - needs restarts for certain types of compilation errors
** xmonad
   - haven't found a simple way to toggle system monitor visibility
   - toggling gnome-panel doesn't recalculate window sizes
** erythrina
   - no way to cycle selection
   - build is awful (blame ocaml ecosystem)
** elim
   - notifications aren't quite right
   - doesn't support jingle
** empathy
   - doesn't seem easy to check config into dotfiles
   - incoming conversations don't show in conversation window until selected

* developing against postgres according to pvh:
  Developing software against a daemonized Postgres is bad practice. Do this instead: 
  $ initdb pg; createdb -D pg db; postgres -D pg -p 5555
  Arg, I got too cute trying to run that as a one-liner in Twitter. createdb has to go after postgres starts, and takes a port, not a datadir.
* multiple xmonad screens

* things that bug me about software I use (a relatively complete list)
** Debian
   - no 32-bit client JVM (wheezy multiarch?)
   - no emacs packages newer than 23
   - mozilla version in squeeze is old
   - powertop watts estimate is off by at least an order of magnitude
   - installer hardcodes ssid/mount point in /etc (reported)
** eshell
   - no tab completion for git branches
   - sudo commands cannot be interrupted
** leiningen
   - version 2 isn't finished
** conkeror
   - it isn't emacs
   - after six months of usage its history starts slowing down completion
** gnus
   - imap is slow
   - doesn't handle switching network connections very well
   - no way to report spam without switching to browser
** rcirc
   - colors don't use consistent hashing
** znc
   - doesn't save session state in between restarts
     (needs to be more than just saving to disk for running on Heroku)
** swank-clojure
   - needs restarts for certain types of compilation errors
** xmonad
   - haven't found a simple way to toggle system monitor visibility
   - toggling gnome-panel doesn't recalculate window sizes
** erythrina
   - no way to cycle selection
   - build is awful (blame ocaml ecosystem)
** elim
   - notifications aren't quite right
   - doesn't support jingle
** empathy
   - doesn't seem easy to check config into dotfiles
   - incoming conversations don't show in conversation window until selected

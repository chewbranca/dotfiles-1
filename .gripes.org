* Software for which I have one or zero legitimate complaints (hall of fame)
  - xmonad
    - with an extra display plugged in, libnotify bubbles show offscreen
      - (probably actually a libnotify bug; dunst works fine)
  - dmenu
  - mpd
    - completely refuses to function when the network is down; won't use lo interface
  - ssh
    - https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613
  - tmux
    - default binding of ctrl-b is stupid
  - gpg
    - refuses to forget cached passphrases on sighup
* Things that bug me about software I use (a relatively complete list)
** Debian Wheezy
   - broken permissions in nm-applet
     http://bugs.debian.org/643028
   - need to teach network-manager it's OK to use device that was used for installation
     - sed -i s/managed=false/managed=true/ /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
     - improvement over squeeze at least
     - (32) Not authorized to control networking.
   - adding an additional keyboard doesn't honor caps->ctrl mod
   - libnotify broken outside gnome
     - claimed to be fixed, but isn't
       - http://bugs.debian.org/636435
       - actual fix
         - file /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service
         - Exec=/usr/lib/notification-daemon/notification-daemon
** nix
   - ships proprietary crap by default
     - to find non-flash firefox: nix-env -qaP firefox | grep -v plugins
   - package searching is really stupid
** Emacs
   - lisp-2 is awful
   - no FFI (no browser integration)
   - no immutability or referential transparency
   - no useful associative data type, vectors are useless
   - no concurrency
   - find-file-at-point does really stupid things sometimes with tramp
*** eshell
   - no tab completion for git branches (but just use magit)
   - high-throughput output is slow
*** erc
   - silently discards input in closed query buffers
*** mu4e
    - doesn't honor .authinfo.gpg
    - silly bindings (M-RET to follow links??)
    - threads are sorted by first message, not last message
    - every operation in overview updates message window if present
      - fixable with advice
** mbsync
   - no docs
   - refuses to create maildir; must manually mkdir
   - no secure password storage
   - no way to say "trust this cert"
** conkeror
   - it isn't emacs
   - after six months of usage its history starts slowing down completion
** Virtualbox
   - OSS version doesn't play nicely with vagrant
   - designed by toolbags who think creating ~/Virtualbox VMs is OK
     - VBoxManage setproperty machinefolder $HOME/.vbox-vms
     - needs a manual `sudo modprobe vboxdrv` to work
** fbpanel
   - doesn't reposition properly when a new display is activated
** ghi
   - coloring doesn't work inside Emacs
   - listing breaks with TERM=dumb
   - doesn't provide an actual git repo to operate upon
** network-manager
   - CLI refuses to connect to new access points
   - stores known access points in gconf super-nested XML files
     - cross-references credentials using nonsense made-up gconf numeric ID
       - gross gross gross
       - also stupid
         - and dumb
   - look into replacing with wpa_supplicant
     http://www.cyber.com.au/~twb/snarf/wifi.txt
** racket
   - hash tables and vectors are quoted by default
   - hash tables are not functions
   - opaque structs are very annoying, absolutely inappropriate for HTTP reqs
   - keywords are not general-purpose
   - boxes are very low-level
   - no general-purpose equality predicate
     - but a lot better than CL/elisp
   - no docstrings (!!!) docs seem very HTML-centric
   - geiser
     - autodoc lists every argument as _
     - really easy to wedge it by launching a blocking server

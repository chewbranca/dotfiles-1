* things that bug me about software I use (a relatively complete list)
** Debian
   - many versions way out of date in squeeze
     - whatever, just use nix
   - powertop watts estimate is off by at least an order of magnitude
     Apparently [[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug%3D497929][fixed upstream]]
   - installer hardcodes ssid/mount point in /etc (reported)
     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=502955 (net)
     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=646795 (fstab)
** nix
   - ships proprietary crap by default
     - to find non-flash firefox: nix-env -qaP firefox | grep -v plugins
** Emacs
   - lisp-2 is awful
   - no FFI (no browser integration)
   - no immutability or referential transparency
   - no useful associative data type, vectors are useless
   - no concurrency
*** eshell
   - no tab completion for git branches (but just use magit)
   - sudo commands cannot be interrupted
   - high-throughput output is slow
*** gnus
   - imap is slow
   - doesn't handle switching network connections very well
   - no way to report spam without switching to browser
   - search is hard to set up
*** erc
   - silently discards input in closed query buffers
   - can't ignore idler join/parts only yet
*** swank-clojure
   - undocumented, messy codebase
   - needs restarts for certain types of compilation errors
** conkeror
   - it isn't emacs
   - after six months of usage its history starts slowing down completion
   - hacker news isn't keyboard-friendly
** xmonad
   - haven't found a simple way to toggle system monitor visibility
   - with an extra display plugged in, libnotify bubbles show offscreen
** erythrina
   - no way to cycle selection
   - build is awful (blame ocaml ecosystem)
** Virtualbox
   - OSS version doesn't play nicely with vagrant
   - designed by toolbags who think creating ~/Virtualbox VMs is OK
     - VBoxManage setproperty machinefolder $HOME/.vbox-vms
** ssh
   - no ~/.ssh/config.d directory
     https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613
** garak
   - sometimes doesn't come back online after the network comes back up
   - awkward widget-based menu selection for connecting/sending messages
** ghi
   - coloring doesn't work inside Emacs
   - listing breaks with TERM=dumb

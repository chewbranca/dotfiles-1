Technomancy Init
by Phil Hagelberg

This script should get you from a fresh installation to awesomely
ready (as defined by what I use). Just run go.sh as root. go.sh
should be able to fetch the other required files if it's run by
itself.

TODO:
- get gnome-terminal to not show menubar (through gconf?)
- panel config
- lists in gconf.yml to support ctrl:nocaps
- don't suspend when lid is closed
- fonts: subpixel, slight hinting, inconsolata as monospace

To save manually:
src, documents, music, Photos, mail (to disk)
.ssh, .gnupg
